# Sickomode_Godot

Yea, I know the name is wired but have some fun with the file. I took out very few textures due to copyright issues.
I will not continue to work on this project, so feel free to add or change things, but please not in the master_branch (is that right so).
I very new to GitHub therefore I may have missed some things

I recommend to download the files as .zip and open the project.godot in Godot. You will find the game scene in main.tscn
